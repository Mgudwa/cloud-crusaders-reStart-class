# Acme Manufacturing Cloud Migration Project

This repository documents the architecture, design, and deployment procedures for migrating Acme Manufacturing's on-premises systems to AWS. This project prioritizes a phased approach, emphasizing security, scalability, and cost-efficiency.  The focus is on a complete infrastructure and application migration, not on a single application or feature.

## Project Goals

The primary objectives of this cloud migration are:

* **Cost Reduction:** Achieve a significant reduction in IT infrastructure costs.
* **Scalability and Agility:** Create a scalable and flexible infrastructure to accommodate future growth and changing business needs.
* **Enhanced Security:** Implement robust security measures to protect sensitive data and comply with relevant regulations.
* **Improved Performance:** Enhance application performance and reduce latency.


## Phased Migration Approach

The project will follow a three-phased approach:

1. **Proof of Concept (POC):**  A non-critical application will be migrated to AWS to validate the chosen architecture and identify potential challenges. This is a low-risk approach to test and refine the migration process.

2. **Gradual Migration:** Critical applications and services will be migrated incrementally, prioritizing based on dependencies and business impact.  This minimizes disruption to ongoing operations.

3. **Optimization and Automation:** Post-migration, the infrastructure will be optimized for cost and performance, and automation will be implemented to streamline operations and maintenance.


## Architecture

The AWS architecture is designed using the Well-Architected Framework, focusing on the five pillars: Operational Excellence, Security, Reliability, Performance Efficiency, and Cost Optimization.  Key components include:

**1. Network Layer:**

* **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud):**  A logically isolated network for all resources.  This includes public and private subnets.
* **Internet Gateway:** Provides access to the public internet for public-facing resources.
* **NAT Gateway:** Enables private instances to access the internet without direct exposure.
* **Security Groups:**  Control inbound and outbound traffic to resources, enforcing least privilege.
* **Route Tables:** Define routing paths for network traffic within the VPC.
* **Direct Connect (Optional):**  For hybrid cloud setups, maintaining connectivity with on-premises infrastructure.
* **VPN (Optional):** Secure remote access to the AWS environment.

**2. Compute Layer:**

* **EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud):**  Virtual machines for applications requiring more control or complex configurations.
* **ECS/EKS (Elastic Container Service/Kubernetes):** For containerized applications.  (Specify if used)
* **Auto Scaling Groups:**  Dynamically scale compute resources based on demand.
* **Load Balancing:** Distribute traffic across multiple instances.

**3. Storage Layer:**

* **S3 (Simple Storage Service):** Object storage for backups, logs, and other unstructured data.
* **EFS (Elastic File System):** Shared file storage for applications requiring shared file access.
* **RDS (Relational Database Service):**  Managed relational database service (specify engine, e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL).  Includes details on instance types, high availability, and backups.

**4. Security Layer:**

* **IAM (Identity and Access Management):**  Granular access control with roles and policies, enforcing least privilege.
* **KMS (Key Management Service):**  Encryption key management for securing data at rest and in transit.
* **GuardDuty:** Continuous threat detection and security monitoring.
* **WAF (Web Application Firewall):** Protects web applications against attacks.
* **CloudTrail:**  Auditing and logging of API calls and other significant actions.

**5. Monitoring and Logging Layer:**

* **CloudWatch:** Centralized monitoring and logging service, providing real-time insights into system health, performance, and security.


## Functionality

The core functionality of this project is the complete migration of Acme Manufacturing's on-premises applications and data to a secure and scalable AWS environment.  This includes:

* **Application Migration:** Moving applications from on-premises servers to AWS compute services (EC2, ECS/EKS).
* **Data Migration:** Transferring data from on-premises databases and storage to appropriate AWS services (RDS, S3).
* **Infrastructure Provisioning:**  Setting up the core network and security infrastructure in AWS.
* **Security Configuration:** Implementing and testing security measures to protect the migrated systems and data.
* **Monitoring and Alerting:**  Setting up monitoring and alerting to ensure system health and identify potential issues.


## Deployment Steps

Detailed deployment steps for each phase will be documented in separate directories within this repository:

* **`poc-deployment`:**  Instructions for the Proof of Concept phase.
* **`pilot-migration`:** Instructions for the Pilot Migration phase.
* **`full-migration`:**  Instructions for the Full Migration phase.
* **`automation-scripts`:**  Scripts for automating various tasks.


Each directory will contain detailed instructions, scripts, and configuration files necessary for that phase of the migration.


## Suggested Documentation to Include

In addition to the above deployment steps, the following documentation will be included in this repository:

* **Architecture Diagram:** A visual representation of the overall architecture.
* **Network Diagrams:**  Detailed diagrams of the VPC, subnets, and routing.
* **Data Migration Plan:** A document outlining the strategy and procedures for migrating data.
* **Security Best Practices:**  Documentation describing the security measures implemented.
* **Runbooks:**  Operational procedures for common tasks and troubleshooting.
* **Testing Procedures:** Test plans and results.


This repository will be kept up-to-date throughout the project lifecycle.
